            <h2>HABITAT</h2>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p> wetlands , spring-fed marshes, sedge meadows, and open areas in close proximity to forest boundaries. Cool, shallow, slow-moving waters provide important larval habitat, and the open areas adjacent to woodlands provide adult hunting and roosting opportunities. Hine's emerald dragonflies usually inhabit water only centimeters deep.</p>

        <div class="population-container">
            <h2>POPULATION</h2>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p>Only a few sites scattered in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri are home to the Hine's emerald dragonfly today. In 2016, it was estimated that only 200 adults were recorded in Illinois. Since then, as recent as 2022, scientists have helped raise greater than 1,000 Hine's eggs and over 300 Hine's Larvae and are also slowly reintroduced in Wisconsin.</p>

            <h3>CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p> Hine's emerald dragonflies have slender, metallic bodies with green, brown, or black coloring. Two distinct yellow lateral strips mark their thorax and fade into white as the dragonflies age. A brilliant, emerald-green color covers their enormous eyes, which possess almost 360-degree peripheral vision. These dragonflies have a wingspan of approximately three-and-a-half inches. Their wings are clear and may have an amber hue toward the base of the hind wings; wings may turn to a slightly opaque smoky color towards the end of life.</p>

            <h4>THREATS</h4>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p> Habitat destruction, urban sprawl, off-road vehicles, agricultural development, road and pipeline construction, logging, and groundwater contamination from pesticides and other contaminants. </p>

        <div class="lifecycle-container">
            <h2>LIFE CYCLE</h2>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p> Larvae live for up to five years, and adults live for at most seven weeks more. It is a short adulthood of feeding, sexual interaction, and egg deposition. When it emerges as an adult, a Hine's emerald dragonfly's eyes are brown, turning bright green within three days</p>
